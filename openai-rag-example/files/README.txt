The default implementation expect two-level directory tree to exist (Directory-Subdirectory). This is used to refer the file locations in the result lists.

You can add any number of directories and subdirectories. The directories can have any names (Directory-Subdirectory are created simply for an example), but you must create the required two-level directory tree.
